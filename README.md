These are the guidelines that I follow for my various personal projects.  As rules differ depending on the language used, there are separate files for each language that I have formulated guidelines for, although they will share many similarities.

You may notice that I do not call these "rules"; this is due to my belief that attaining the end-goal, which is superior readability and maintainability, sometimes requires breaking of the rules.

You are not in any way obligated to follow these in your own code, nor do I necessarily expect you to.  This repository exists primarily for me.  It is here, rather than:

  - on my blog, because I haven't bothered getting it up yet.
  - on a wiki page for a project, because it's more general than that.
  - on my GitHub page, because I don't feel like it.
